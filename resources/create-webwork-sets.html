This Python script creates WebWork sets with specified deadlines quickly. You will need to modify several variables which appear at the top.

# This Python script creates WebWork sets with specified deadlines quickly.
# Filename: create-webwork-sets.py
# Author: Edward D. Kim, UW-La Crosse

# INSTRUCTIONS
# Set the variables in the next section. The openDate is used for all sets.
# To keep the sets in order, the open time matches the set's 2-digit number (in the minutes portion)
# Pay attention especially to daylight versus standard time in setting the dueDT.
# You do not have to have a set numbered '00'. I typically use this as a prerequisite review set.
# I am using the due date/time as the answer date/time. This serves my needs, but this script is easily modified for other uses!

# After setting all the due dates and running, many WeBWorK set definition files will be created.
# These files should be put in a .tar (on Windows, you can use 7-Zip) and then uploaded to WeBWorK's file manager.
# WeBWorK will automatically un-tar the files. They can then be imported in the Homework Sets Editor.
