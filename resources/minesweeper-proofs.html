<p>
The "raised" cells are unknowns.
The more "indented" cells are knowns.
(Intended cells without a number are zeros: none of the 8 surrounding cells are mines.)
The cells which have a red triangular flag are marked by the game player (usually by right-clicking) to indicate that these are mines.
</p>

<p>
To carefully understand, let us consider the following example.
The cell labeled 2 to the right of Cell Y should have two mines.
The cell to the upper right (with a 2), the cell to the right (with a 1), the cell to the lower right (blank, so a zero), and the cell below (the 1 to the right of Z) have all been cleared.
The cell above the 2 is already marked as a mine. While that spot is "technically not known", the person playing felt confident enough to mark that spot a mine.
In addition, Cell X, Cell Y, and Cell Z are unknowns.

<p>
For an example of the language of proof that can be used, let us consider the same example.
The cell labeled 2 to the right of Cell Y should have two mines.
Since there is already one marked mine,
among the three cells Cell X, Cell Y, and Cell Z, exactly one of these is a mine.

<h1>Tasks (in order of difficulty)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Prove: If the Minesweeper configuration is as given above, then Cell I is safe. (Hint: Proof by contradiction)</li>
<li>Prove: If the Minesweeper configuration is as given above, then Cell N is safe. (Hint: Proof by cases)</li>
<li>Prove: If the Minesweeper configuration is as given above, then Cell V is safe.</li>
</ul>
