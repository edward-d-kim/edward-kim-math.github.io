The existing website (made in Summer 2013) outgrew its original (and inflexible) design. I have ported the existing content to a Jekyll-based site and moved it to GitHub, which will give me easier access to the site. Some of the content may not work perfectly, and some ironing out of formatting needs to be done. There is a new Talks page, and I hope to add posts to a Posts page with updates and a bit of an academic blog.

Hopefully, a full move of content won't take too long. This page should also display fairly nicely on tablets and phones.
