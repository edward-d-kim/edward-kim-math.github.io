Hi Justin, I think I might have been unclear to you in my previous post what I meant by disproportionateness, and for that I apologize. I hope you will forgive me. I would like to clarify what I meant. Now, you said in your post to me that I’m practically a genius, and that I have math mastered. To be honest, I don’t know if I’d go so far as to say I’m a genius, but I will say – with no attempt to brag – that I understand mathematics. It’s been a decade now since I’ve earned my Ph.D. in math, and since then I have learned even more. I have also gained a LOT in terms of experience in making math as clear as possible, so I hope you’ll please read with interest the next part:
<br><br>
Imagine you have two large paper bags, Bag A and Bag B. Both bags have red cards and green cards. If you pull a green card, something good happens to you. If you pull a red card, something bad happens to you. You are told that there are 10 red cards in Bag A and there are 21 red cards in Bag B. Which bag would you choose? (That is, the cards within a specific bag will be well-shuffled. If you had to point to a bag, and your fate is determined by the randomly-selected card from the bag you chose, which bag would be most advantageous?)
<br><br>

Based on this information, it would make sense to pick Bag A, since there are fewer red (representing bad) cards, right? (In fact, there are more than twice as many red cards in Bag B than in Bag A.) Even though there are fewer red cards in Bag A, that won’t translate into preferring Bag A. It depends on how many green cards there are in each bag, too! Say you’re now told that, in Bag A, there are exactly 10 red cards (as before), but there’s exactly 10516 green cards in Bag A. You’re also told that Bag B has exactly 21 red cards (as before), and exactly 53129 green cards. Which bag should you choose?
<br><br>

Now that we know the entire contents of both bags, we can make an informed decision. Which bag should we choose? Since Bag A has 10 red cards and 10526 cards overall, there is a 0.0950% chance of picking a red card when selecting Bag A, since 10 divided by 10526 in a calculator is 0.0009500285. Since Bag B has 21 red cards and 53150 cards overall, there is a 0.0395% chance of picking a red card when selecting Bag B, since 21 divided by 53150 in a calculator is 0.00039510818.
<br><br>

With the more complete information, is it advisable to pick Bag A where there’s a 0.0950% chance of a bad outcome, or Bag B with its 0.0395% chance of a bad outcome? Clearly, the right bag to select is Bag B.
<br><br>

With limited info earlier, Bag A seemed advantageous. With more complete info, Bag B is advantageous. In math, we call an example like this a paradox: there’s no actual funny business with the math, but it *seems* like there’s an oxymoron, but there isn’t really an oxymoron. The analogy here is that instead of the green cards representing something *good*, they should just represent something *neutral*. So, perhaps instead of green cards, they should have been gray cards. (Oops, sorry, my bad.) Still, the math works out exactly the same if you change all the green cards to gray. What about the red cards? They represent getting shot and killed OUTSIDE the of the constitutional process of a trial in a court of law. Bag A represents the black American population and Bag B represents the white American population.
<br><br>

I should note that these are not the actual numbers, but I am taking the actual numbers and scaling down. (It is useful in math to sometimes use smaller numbers – in an accurate manner – to make a point clearer.) By this scaling, I mean applying the concept that two sixths is the same as one third.
<br><br>

I even worked this example to incorporate the data you shared. In the table you presented, I note that the most drastic year was 2017, with 457 white Americans shot to death by police and 223 black Americans shot to death by police. Note that 457/223 in a calculator is 2.04932735426 and this ratio is closely replicated by having 21 red cards in Bag B and 10 red cards in Bag A, since 21/10 in a calculator is 2.1. 
<br><br>

You might ask, okay, then, where the hell are people getting numbers such as “you’re 2.4 times more likely to die at the hands of police if you’re black than if you’re white”? This is a good question. You need to take 0.0950% (from earlier) and divide by 0.0395% (from earlier). Actually, to avoid some level of roundoff error, I invite you to type (10/10526)/(21/53150) into Google. This calculates to 2.40, roughly.
<br><br>

The point is that the numbers 457 and 223 alone do not capture the scope of the problem. I’m asking us – all of us – are we asking the right *question*? It’s important to not take the number 457 alone, but to know what to *do* with it. The thing to note is that 457 is the numerator of a *very* relevant fraction in this discussion, and the picture you shared lacks the denominator of that fraction. Likewise, 223 is the numerator of the fraction, but the image you shared doesn’t provide information about the denominator.
<br><br>

The missing denominators are key pieces of information. It’s easy to misuse or misinterpret numbers: it’s not just about whether a number is accurate or not, but what you *do* with the number to understand the actual issue. In other words, someone else could produce another picture much like the one you sent, except the new picture has the numbers 0.0950% for Black Americans and 0.0395% for White Americans. Then, the mathematician in me witnesses in horror online in social media (I’m not saying you do this, but I have witnessed it) where two people just share “image facts” to each other that are seemingly contradictory, and each person just thinks, “Well, it’s your word against mine.”
<br><br>

But Justin, we both know – facts are facts. Here’s the thing: comparing 457 and 223 alone (for example) is misleading. I don’t want anybody to trick you, because I want you to have full picture. For the person who made that image, they either don’t understand the mathematics of what they need to present, or they had deceptive intent.
<br><br>

I hope that the numbers issue is clearer. And I tried to write with no desire to put you down in any way at all. If I have been unclear in my explanation, I ask for two things. First, I ask you to forgive me for giving a shitty explanation. Second, I ask you to give me another chance: we can have a ZOOM video call or something and go through the details.
<br><br>

Just like with my own students, I do think that *anyone* can understand all the math, if properly explained, so give me an opportunity to answer any confusions of math, please! I also hope that, if you’re unsure about what I’m saying, you’ll also keep in a mind a thing you said: you called me a genius. I hope you’ll see that I wouldn’t allow myself to be bamboozled by someone trying to pull a fast one on me with numbers. I’ve got a freakin’ doctorate in math: numbers are my jam!
<br><br>

When working in an actual face-to-face conversation about math, I have the benefit of getting to see the other person’s face, and they have the ability to interrupt me to ask questions. So, I’d like to say what I’m about to say next, just in case you might might might distrust the math I described:
<br><br>

For the sake of discussion, let’s just say that I’m actually incorrect about the facts. Let’s say either the data I looked up is wrong, the mathematical computations are wrong, I’m asking the wrong questions, or some combination of these three things. (I assure you, as a mathematician, that’s not the case, but let’s just *assume* I’m mathematically wrong.)
<br><br>

In that unlikely scenario, let’s discuss what the purpose of the table you shared is. On some level, the image was to persuade me to not stand up for my black neighbors, friends, colleagues, and students. At the worst, even if it wasn’t *actually* said in these words, there’s the suggestion of, “Eddie, you’re so mathematically stupid to be duped into standing up for black Americans” and at the best, there’s a suggestion (again not in these actual words, but the spirit of it) of “Eddie, it’s irrational for you to worry about and stand up for these people, because the data show that they don’t actually need or deserve you.” I’ll assume the best case scenario of your motives (because I try to assume the best of people). So then where are we? Let me say it this: nobody is EVER going to be able to present ANY fact to me (whether it is true or false, whether I have interpreted properly or not) to convince me to be less compassionate.
<br><br>

Let me repeat that: if I’m working on being compassionate and caring for my neighbor, there is NOTHING that ANYONE can EVER present to me that’s going to convince me to be less compassionate. I don’t know if you meant it this way, but presenting that picture with the table of data was – I interpreted it anyway – as a way to try to convince me to serve my neighbor less, to be less compassionate. Not gonna happen.
<br><br>

Let’s take that thought all the way through. What is a key corollary of this? If my neighbor is in trouble and genuinely needs my help, I’m going to help them out, even if it would not be rational from a statistical, financial, or whatever other point of view.
<br><br>

This includes for you, because I care about you. I’d give you the shirt off my back if you need it. And I mean it. I also should clarify that I’m not trying to make myself a saint here. I fail at the process of being compassionate, because I’m human. I fail at it all the time. But what I’m saying is: you cannot present a fact (especially a faulty fact) and based on that, convince me, “Gee, I didn’t know that. I guess I should be less compassionate.” Won’t happen.
<br><br>

I should also note that an important part of the BLM movement is reforming police detaining processes. That’s good for all of us. It’s good for you. It’s good for me. It’s good for our Black siblings. It’s good for all Americans, citizen and non-citizen resident alike. Let me be clear why I mention this: my own benefit is *not* the reason I support BLM. I just mention it as a side note in case this gives you (or anyone else reading) a *personally*-beneficial reason to join the cause.
<br><br>

Again, I don’t want to make a saint out of myself, but it’s not about me. Instead of writing a lengthy post, I could be working on my math research which leads towards promotion and higher salary. I could elect to not give money to BLM advocacy groups. If I were thinking about *me*, my actions would be very different.
<br><br>

In your post, you mentioned that it’s bad that minorities are disproportionately killed. You said it in your words: it’s time to stop this shit. You said: police killing anyone unjustly is wrong. Yep. Justin, I agree with you on these points. 100%.
<br><br>

I also wish to reiterate a point I made last time: independent of facts, there are people who are afraid. Afraid they won’t get to live. Afraid, so they coach their kids on how to survive during an interaction with police. This ALONE should be enough reason (with or without numbers) to support our black neighbors.
<br><br>

In another post, you bring another point, and I’m glad that you did. You asked, “Do you ever think we’ll get to a place in America that when someone who is wrongfully killed the color of their skin will stop being a factor?” I’ll be honest: I don’t know. But I have to do my part. I don’t want you to use the unsure answer to this question as the reason to give up. Based on the fact that you asked the question in the first place, I take it to mean that the result of unjust killing tears at your heart too.
<br><br>

When I’m old (and retired) and, possibly on my death bed, I’m sure that I will have no regrets for raising money for BLM advocacy. I’ll have no regrets if my reapportioned time meant I didn’t get promoted to Full Professor at work. This double-whammy of lower finances won’t matter to me as I leave this Earth. But I would regret if I didn’t do anything for my neighbors in pain when given a chance.
<br><br>

If we as a society collectively do nothing, things won’t remain the same: they’ll get worse. Checks and balances. It is one of the primary principles of our Constitution. Speaking of our Constitution, the 6th Amendment guarantees persons due process in the “right to a speedy and public trial.” Let’s advocate for this for our black neighbors: you in California, and me in Wisconsin. The US Supreme Court building is emblazoned “Equal justice under law” on the western side. We’re not there yet, but Americans of every color and political party have good reason to support our black neighbors who live in fear, to strive for justice and equality. To participate in this work is very American. It is upholding our Constitution. It is patriotic.
<br><br>

But most importantly, it is ethical. So, will you (you, who recognizes there is injustice in the current system) join in this cause?
