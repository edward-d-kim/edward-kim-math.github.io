  <ul>
    <li>Here's the 6-port USB charger that I travel with:
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2MMuQgc">Anker 60W 6-Port USB Wall Charger, PowerPort 6</a>
    </li>

    <li>Besides having one long cable, I prefer having the rest be a bunch of <a href="https://amzn.to/2wkk7Py">short USB cables</a>
      to charge the backup battery, tablet, phone, smart watch, etc.</li>
    
    <li>The back up battery that I have is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2nVt9if">Aluratek 16000 mAh USB backup battery with solar panel</a></li>
    
    <li>Amazon does not carry the pick set that I like the best. It's the <a href="https://www.southord.com/collections/lock-pick-sets-standard/products/lock-pick-set-14-piece-pxs-14">Southord PXS-14</a> pick set. It's not the full-featured one, but it's not lacking anything major either. Middle of the road price point.</li>
