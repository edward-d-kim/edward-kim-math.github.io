<li>$30 Berhinger Powerplay PM1 accepts 1 XLR in, has voluem knob, and accepts 3.5mm headphones. While there is no power source needed, this product is <a href="https://forum.musictri.be/showthread.php?12149-Behringer-PM1">not designed for balanced line signals</a> from a mixer. You need to connect an amplified source.</li>
<li>$50 Behringer Powerplay P1 accepts to 2 XLR ins, has knobs for volume and for balance, a switch for stereo/mono, accepts 3.5mm headphones. Powered by 9V or mains</li>
<li>$40 Behringer Powerplay P2 has a combo (XLR/TRS) input and volume knob. Runs on two AAA batteries</li>

<h2>Wired in-ear monitoring, stand alone style</h2>
A guitarist/bassist (or even a keyboardist) might appreciate combining products below with <a href="https://www.tc-helicon.com/Categories/Tchelicon/Vocal/Accessories/GUITAR-%26-HEADPHONE-CABLE/p/P0CM2">this guitar and headphone cable</a>.

The use of a headphone amplifier may be bypassed (by one performer) by using the headphone output. Note that <a href="https://forum.musictri.be/showthread.php?10153-XR18-Routing-Stereo-Headphone-Cue-Mix">output routing on the Behringer XR18</a> is a <a href="https://forum.musictri.be/showthread.php?10153-XR18-Routing-Stereo-Headphone-Cue-Mix">two-step process</a> (headphone source is monitor, monitor source is, e.g., Bus 3) and that using Solo overrides the monitor source.

<h2>Personal monitor mixers</h2>
Devices that allow for more than three inputs to be mixed locally. (The PM351 supports three inputs.) These are probably all Ultranet-based:

<h2>Wireless in-ear monitoring, via Bluetooth</h2>
Read <a href="http://got-djent.com/content/in-ear-monitors-vs-bluetooth">discussion on in-ear traditional systems versus Bluetooth</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.telme2.com/blog/what-is-aptx-and-latency">November 2017 article</a>, the best aptX (of the two kinds) has a latency of 35ms. A read of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AptX">Wikipedia article on aptX</a> suggests there's more than two kinds of aptX, and the one that looks intriguing is aptX Low Latency: the wiki article mentions an end-to-end latency of 32ms over Bluetooth. A user at a <a href="https://line6.com/support/topic/32650-anyone-use-headphone-out-bluetooth-transmitter-in-ear-monitors/">forum post</a> suggests <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B4W40VC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1</a>this $30 transmitter</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073DZMWD1/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this $15 receiver</a> as the winning combinotion. Perhaps the combination is good, but the trasmitter has on its Amazon page "The latency of 40ms is still unacceptable for live sound monitoring. Therefore, those who plan to use it with electric paino or guitar, beware! Bluetooth technology, even with aptX Low Latency, may not suit your needs;
".<br><br>
Some people have done a <a href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/tests/active-features/latency">latency test</a>.

... combined with some cabling and a headphone amplifier to create a wireless in-ear monitoring system?
