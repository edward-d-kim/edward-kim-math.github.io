<h2>Wired in-ear monitoring, belt pack style</h2>
<ul>
<li>$30 Berhinger Powerplay PM1 accepts 1 XLR in, has voluem knob, and accepts 3.5mm headphones. While there is no power source needed, this product is <a href="https://forum.musictri.be/showthread.php?12149-Behringer-PM1">not designed for balanced line signals</a> from a mixer. You need to connect an amplified source.</li>
<li>$50 Behringer Powerplay P1 accepts to 2 XLR ins, has knobs for volume and for balance, a switch for stereo/mono, accepts 3.5mm headphones. Powered by 9V or mains</li>
<li>$40 Behringer Powerplay P2 has a combo (XLR/TRS) input and volume knob. Runs on two AAA batteries</li>

<h2>Wired in-ear monitoring, stand alone style</h2>
A guitarist/bassist (or even a keyboardist) might appreciate combining products below with <a href="https://www.tc-helicon.com/Categories/Tchelicon/Vocal/Accessories/GUITAR-%26-HEADPHONE-CABLE/p/P0CM2">this guitar and headphone cable</a>.
<ul>
<li>$25 Behringer Micromon MA400</li>
<li>Rolls PM50s</li>
<li>Rolls PM351</li>

</ul>
The use of a headphone amplifier may be bypassed (by one performer) by using the headphone output. Note that <a href="https://forum.musictri.be/showthread.php?10153-XR18-Routing-Stereo-Headphone-Cue-Mix">output routing on the Behringer XR18</a> is a two-step process (headphone source is monitor, monitor source is, e.g., Bus 3) and that using Solo overrides the monitor source.

<h2>Wireless in-ear monitoring, traditional systems</h2>

<h2>Wireless in-ear monitoring, via wireless guitar systems</h2>
Can one use a wireless guitar system such as

<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
... combined with some cabling and a headphone amplifier to create a wireless in-ear monitoring system?
